        <p>Begin with opening the sample photo. Take note of the lighting. This photo is taken on a dull backgrounds, which means we have to brighten the photo and make sure we stay true to the values of color that are present.</p>

        <img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-02%20at%2012.00.19%20PM.png" alt="Photo of Zac">

        <p>To begin this process, check the levels of the photo. The levels pallet can be found by going into
            <b>Image - Ajustments - Levels.</b>
        </p>

        <img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-02%20at%2012.00.08%20PM.png" alt="Photo of levels">

        <p>I've adjusted the levels to just touching each edge of the histogram. This is as far as they should go, in order to keep the skin tones and colours natural.</p>

        <p>You should have something like this:</p>

        <img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-02%20at%2012.00.26%20PM.png" alt="Brighter photo of Zac">

        <p>Now we need to crop the photo to give it a better format. The best way to do this is to look at how the photo is set up. Some of the photos have the board set to the left, or have two people in them. The main focus for these images is the face and the board. All other details are minor. The main goal is to have an image that is almost square.
            <p>

                <img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-02%20at%2012.51.18%20PM.png" alt="Crop image">
                <p>Use the crop tool and erase the values in the width and height area.</p>

                <img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-02%20at%2012.01.29%20PM.png" alt="Cropped photo of Zac">

                <p>As you can see, the photo is not square. The height is much more then the width, but we can even this out when we add the boarder.</p>


                <p>But we need to make this photo black and white first.</p>

                <p>Select the black and white tool.
                    <b>Image - Adjustments - Black and White</b>
                </p>


                <img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-02%20at%2012.04.04%20PM.png" alt="Black and white image">

                <p>The photo is dull and very flat. In order to adjust this, we need to look at the values in the image. Zac is wearing a pink shirt, which is the dullest value in this image. we can darken that to give the board and his skin some contrast.</p>


                <p>There are two ways to navigate values. You'll notice that when you turn the photo black and white, there are values automatically imputed. These are good values, but in some cases, like with Zac's photo, we need to tweak it.</p>

                <img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-04%20at%203.31.54%20PM.png" alt="Black and white control panel">

                <p>(I have the newest version of photoshop, if it dosen't look indentical it's alright.) The lowest value is magentas.</p>

                <p>Zac's hair and skin both have a red undertone. So by adjusting the red value, we can change his main colour.</p>

                <img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-04%20at%203.36.47%20PM.png" alt="adjusted control panel">

                <p>This is the result of making the red darker.</p>

                <img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-04%20at%203.36.56%20PM.png" alt="Image of Zac">

                <p>This image is way to dark, and takes away the details in his shirt and hair. Instead of adjusting a value that encompases so much of the picture, it's much easier to tweak that value to something a bit lighter. Once the overall value is okay, you can change a more specific colour.</p>

                <img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-04%20at%203.45.01%20PM.png" alt="black and white colour pallete">

                <p>There won't be a huge difference in the image, but it's enough to keep the values true to the colour. Now look for the part you want to make lighter or darker. Once you've choosen, notice the most prominate colour from your pallete. If you're not sure, turn of the black and white layer, and play with the Hue and Saturation Pallete.
                    <b>Image - Adjustments - Hue/Saturation</b>
                </p>

                <p>Now that you know which colour to work with, adjust it to make the contrast that looks natural and compliments the lights or darks of the photo.</p>
        
        <img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-04%20at%203.57.12%20PM.png" alt="black and white pallete">
        
        <p>The result is a crisper photo and better contrast. The one on the right has the magenta adjustment.</p>
        
        <img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-04%20at%204.00.09%20PM.png" alt="2 images of zac">

        
        <p>Now that the photo is how we'd like it, we can create the border.</p>
        
        <p>First, we need to merge the layers together to create one single layer. The best way to do this </p>
