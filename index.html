    <p>Begin with opening the sample photo. Take note of the lighting. This photo is taken on a dull backgrounds, which means we have to brighten the photo and make sure we stay true to the values of color that are present.</p>
        
        <img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-02%20at%2012.00.19%20PM.png" alt="Photo of Zac">
        
        <p>To begin this process, check the levels of the photo. The levels pallet can be found by going into <b>Image - Ajustments - Levels.</b></p>
        
        <img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-02%20at%2012.00.08%20PM.png" alt="Photo of levels">
        
        <p>I've adjusted the levels to just touching each edge of the histogram. This is as far as they should go, in order to keep the skin tones and colours natural.</p> 

        <p>You should have something like this:</p>
        
        <img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-02%20at%2012.00.26%20PM.png" alt="Brighter photo of Zac">
        
      <p>Now we need to crop the photo to give it a better format. The best way to do this is to look at how the photo is set up. Some of the photos have the board set to the left, or have two people in them. The main focus for these images is the face and the board. All other details are minor. The main goal is to have an image that is almost square.<p>
        
        <img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-02%20at%2012.51.18%20PM.png" alt="Crop image">
        <p> Use the crop tool and erase the values in the width and height area.</p>  </p>
        
    <img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-02%20at%2012.01.29%20PM.png" alt="Cropped photo of Zac">
 
        <p>As you can see, the photo is not square. The height is much more then the width, but we can even this out when we add the boarder.</p>
    

    <p>But we need to make this photo black and white first.</p>
    
    <p>Select the black and white tool. <b>Image - Adjustments - Black and White</b></p>
    
    
    <img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-02%20at%2012.04.04%20PM.png" alt="Black and white image">
    
    <p>The photo is dull and very flat. In order to adjust this, we need to look at the values in the image. Zac is wearing a pink shirt, which is the dullest value in this image. we can darken that to give the board and his skin some contrast.</p>
